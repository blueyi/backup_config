Bugs I don't have control over (because of limitations in Qt or Plasma):
- make configuring the plasmoid's icon more elegant by showing the current
  icon on the button that launches the "Change icon" dialog and by removing
  the text field holding the icon's name (only possible when KConfigXT finally
  supports Icon)
- provide a command line to open/close the menu
- maybe add "Recent Documents" section (below Favorites?) (only possible when
  a dataengine implementing this functionality exists)
- allow to modify the ordering of the "leave" buttons (must find a way in
  KConfig XT to do this)
For the following a hackish solution is implemented (the non-hackish solution
is currently not implementable because of limitations in Qt or Plasma):
- use powermanagement dataengine instead of qdbus (only possible when the
  modifications in the plasma/viranch/powermanagementservices branch and
  more are merged in git:kde-workspace master)
