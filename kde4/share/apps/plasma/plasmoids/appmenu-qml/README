Description
-----------

This plasmoid shows a menu of the installed applications, similar to
Lancelot but much simpler.  The purpose of the simpleness is to have
a faster plasmoid which also loads faster.  The plasmoid also has a list
of favorites and you can search applications by application name.  There
are "Lock Session", "Leave" and "Switch User" buttons.

The plasmoid can be completely manipulated with the keyboard only except
for the buttons at the bottom wich must be clicked with the mouse.
The menu can be browsed with the arrow keys, a favorite can be added
with the + or = key and removed with the - key, to search an application
by its name, just start typing the name.

This plasmoid is entirely written in QML + JavaScript.
