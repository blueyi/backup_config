version 1.6 (2013-07-31):
- do not show the "Add favorite" and "Remove favorite" buttons in the
  search menu when the favorites are locked
- the "Add Favorite" and "Remove Favorite" buttons are not visible anymore
  if the favorites section is hidden
- dragging an application from the menu to the panel or the desktop creates
  a shortcut there
- the favorites can be reordered using drag-and-drop
version 1.5.1 (2013-03-07):
- correct some small mistakes in the Italian translation (by Vincenzo Reale)
version 1.5 (2013-02-12):
- fix bug: when the search text field is focused, pressing the left
  or right arrow key doesn't focus the menu, leading to unexpected
  behavior
- fix bug: if the search field is emptied (using the Backspace key)
  when an item in the search list is focused, then the main menu is
  not focused, so the left and right arrow keys don't work
- add option to hide the description in the menu items
- add option to check more thoroughly for empty submenus to hide them
  (by default some effort is already done to hide the empty submenus,
  but the search for empty submenus is not comprehensive); this however
  leads to a slower startup of the plasmoid
- when the plasmoid is added to the desktop and it is activated (using
  a keyboard shortcut), then the search field is automatically focused
  (this seems to work only when there are no open windows or when the
  dashboard is shown)
- restore feature: show tooltips for the "Leave" buttons when the text
  is not shown on them
- add Brazilian Portuguese translation (by AndrÃ© Marcelo Alvarenga)
- update French, German and Italian translation (by their authors)
version 1.4 (2013-01-14):
- reimplement the search using a PlasmaCore.SortFilterModel so that it
  is faster (there is however a lag on the first search because the model
  must then be loaded; the other possibility would be to load the model
  at startup of the plasmoid, but IMHO Plasma loads already slow enough)
- add PageUp and PageDown support in the menus
- reimplementation of the "Leave" toolbar
- fix bug: when an app which is also a favorite is uninstalled (e.g. at
  the transition KMail -> KMail2, KOffice -> Calligra, OpenOffice ->
  LibreOffice, when the user switches from Firefox to Google Chrome, or
  from Konqueror to Rekonq, ...), at the next restart of the plasmoid only
  this entry will be removed from the favorites list instead of uncleanly
  failing to load the entire favorites list
- add option to have "Sleep" (Suspend to RAM) and "Hibernate" (Suspend to
  Disk) buttons
- specify a preferred width of the plasmoid and have the minimum width
  smaller than this
- update translations (by their authors)
version 1.3 (2012-10-10):
- make the menu close after the user clicks/opens a program
- make the "Menu Editor", "Lock Favorites" and "Unlock Favorites" items
  in the plasmoid's context menu work again in KDE Plasma 4.9.2 when
  using systemd
- show a tooltip when the user hovers the plasmoid's icon in a panel
  when KDE Plasma from git is used (I guess that it will work in KDE
  Plasma 4.10)
version 1.2 (2012-09-19):
- the gap between the menu and the "Leave" buttons is larger now.
- allow to hide unwanted "Leave" buttons (or hide even all of them)
- new "Leave" buttons: "Log Out", "Turn Off Computer" and "Restart",
  all without showing a confirmation dialog
- update translations (by their authors)
version 1.1 (2012-08-17):
- the favorites list can be locked; when unlocked (the default),
  the "Add favorite", "Remove favorite", "Move favorite up",
  "Move favorite down" buttons remain always visible
- replace our customized versions of PlasmaComponents.Button and
  PlasmaComponents.ToolButton with other items which are easier to
  maintain and which rely more on the standard components
- show tooltips for the "Leave" buttons when the text is not shown on them
- some optimization by not loading unnecessary favorites management buttons
  and arrow images in the menus
- update translations (by their authors)
version 1.0 (2012-06-29):

version 1.0-beta (2012-04-25):
- add Greek translation (by Antonis Geralis)
- update Italian translation (by Francesco Marinucci)
- add German translation (by Susan Janet Voitel)
- allow entering "+", "-" and "=" in the search field without adding or
  removing a favorite; when the search field is not focused but the search
  results are, then using these keys adds or removes a favorite
- remove bug: switching to too deep submenus makes the plasmoid forget the
  highlighted item in the favorites list and main menus
version 0.7.6 (2012-04-05):
- remove bug: the small icon size is obeyed by none of the small icons
- add option to change the icon size of the leave buttons
- remove bug: in KDE Plasma 4.8.2 the implementation of
  PlasmaComponents.Highlight has changed (improved), making the highlight
  fit too tight to the item it is highlighting
- remove other bugs in the implementation of the highlight
version 0.7.5 (2012-04-02):
- opening submenus is faster now (but the area for non-existing submenus is
  now not hidden anymore)
- respect "NoDisplay=true" in .desktop files
- add option to reset menu to its original state each time it is shown
version 0.7.4 (2012-03-28):

  were allowed)

- remove bug: when favorites are reordered, the reordering is not remembered
  when Plasma is restarted
- change service type to Plasma/PopupApplet
- the menu disappears when it loses focus
- the menu window is resizable by dragging its border
- the search field is focused automatically when the menu is shown
- even when the search field is focused, the menu can be browsed with the
  arrow keys
- even when the menus are focused, a search can be triggered just by pressing
  a key containing a valid character
version 0.6 (2011-11-02):
- make sure that switching to submenus doesn't make the plasmoid forget the
  highlighted item in the favorites list and main menus
- add "move up" and "move down" icons to each item in the favorites list,
  so reordering the favorites is now possible
- make the size of the icons in the menus configurable
- make the size of the popup window configurable
version 0.5.5 (2011-10-31):
- make sure that entering characters in the search field doesn't block the
  user interface anymore
- remove option to switch between search while typing and search only when
  Enter is pressed (because of the above and for better maintainability of
  the code)
version 0.5.4 (2011-10-24):
- add option to stop scrolling the menus at their boundaries
- add option to switch between search while typing and search only when
  Enter is pressed
- add margins so that the menus aren't squeezed to the left screen border
version 0.5.3 (2011-10-21):
- in order for the slowness of the search not to be too invasive, the search
  is not performed anymore on the fly when the search field is edited, but
  only when enter is pressed
version 0.5.2 (2011-10-20):
- remove bug: search doesn't show the applications for which the first word
  of the name, generic name or description matches the search string
version 0.5.1 (2011-10-18):
- partially remove bug (introduced by the patch of Onur-Hayri Bakici): the
  keys didn't work anymore; now the keys work again after first clicking
  in the search field
version 0.5 (2011-10-18):
- add option to change the icon of the launcher button (until KConfigXT
  finally supports Icon, a workaround is used which causes the bug that
  the button in the configuration dialog which is used to change the icon
  doesn't show the icon when the configuration dialog is made visible)
- remove bug (thanks Onur-Hayri Bakici for the patch): when the popup window
  of the plasmoid is opened, it appears as a separate entry in the taskbar
version 0.4 (2011-10-17):
- since using Plasma/PopupApplet in metadata.desktop doesn't work in KDE 4.7,
  we use a workaround to make sure that there is only a button in the taskbar
  which when pressed pops the menu up
- use qdbus instead of the power management data engine until the
  modifications in the plasma/viranch/powermanagementservices branch
  are merged in git:kde-workspace master
- enable the usage of the up and down cursor keys and the Enter key when
  the search field is focused
